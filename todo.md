## References
foreach file in ./html:
    extract references list: 
        - parse each reference. Do we search pubmed, or can we parse the html into our target data structure? Need to assign a unique id to each reference.
        - (document_idx, reference_idx)
        -
    


<ReferenceAnchorPoint uuid=[xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]/>
- Multiple references can be anchored here. This is just an anchor point.
