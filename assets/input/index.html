                            Psychiatric symptoms of hypothyroidism are often primary and prominent and include impaired
                            memory,
                            psychomotor slowing and reduced attention span, all of which are symptoms of
                            MDD<sup>8</sup>.

                            between the two<sup>9</sup>.
